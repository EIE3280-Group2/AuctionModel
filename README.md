This repository contain the source code for the auction model written by EIE3280 Group2.

## Run the python file

To create a virtual environment, decide upon a directory where you want to place it, and run the venv module as a script with the directory path:

```shell
python -m venv eie3280-env
```

Once youâ€™ve created a virtual environment, you may activate it.

On Windows, run:

```powershell
eie3280-env\Scripts\activate.bat
```

On Unix or MacOS, run:

```bash
source eie3280-env/bin/activate
```

(This script is written for the bash shell. If you use the csh or fish shells, there are alternate activate.csh and activate.fish scripts you should use instead.)

Install the dependencies:

```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

And then you can run the program.
